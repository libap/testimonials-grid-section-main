        <p> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve
          been
          looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
          here. I
          signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
          shortly
          thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since
          completing
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a
          Software
          Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

        <p> ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code.
          I needed
          some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
          encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The
          entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
          long for
          assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next
          level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during
          interviews as an
          example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer
          after receiving multiple offers.

            find
            really
            refreshing. The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world
